##举一个过往经历的具体例子，讲解你是如何快速熟悉一个全新的事物？你具体做了什么？

在大一时，我加入了学生会的生活部，工作是负责活动物品的购买和报账，比如演讲比赛要买奖品，年级大会购买物资等都需要你的参与，很快就会给你安排工作，索要尽快熟悉。
首先，我习惯对全新工作有一个全面的认识，在部长讲解工作流程和要求时在笔记本上做记录，尽量完整记录，在实际操作时按照笔记内容一点一点对照。在了解整体流程的同时把握细节，比如发票抬头，账户，发票报账文档的整理规范等。
在对工作主干有着清楚的认知后，吸取前人的经验，能让工作更加轻松，也能让人更快上手。比如学生会的工作你就可以主动向前辈询问，比如哪些当地超市可以直接开发票，哪些网络店铺比较适合等，就减少了你自己慢慢摸索的时间。
最后，按照自己所对新事物的全面了解，在实践中应用，哪怕做得不够好也要把事情坚持做完，第一次做完之后我就有了很多的经验，在哪一步中需要注意哪些事项，我已了然于心，做完之后总结一下经验反思一下如何进行改进，实践是最好的老师，在理论知识掌握好的基础上，只有实践才能最快让你熟悉一个全新的事务。


##在团队合作中遇到不给力拖后腿的队友，你是如何处理的？
我会分清楚这个队友的情况与态度，
如果是确实是能力有限但态度端正的话，可以给他尝试的机会，并不是团队中所有人都相当优秀，成员能力参差不齐可以理解。可以先给他分配较为简单的工作，循序渐进，其他成员对他加以帮扶，只要逐渐进步学习，逐步熟悉工作提高能力，下次合作不再托后腿，也是可以理解的。
如果是态度不端正，自己不思进取，偷懒取巧，故意托团队后腿。那应该向上反应，将这个队友剔除掉。团队合作需要每个人的参与，不患寡而患不均，他的任务不能正常处理的话总有其他人来帮他擦屁股，这是变相的损害其他人的利益。任务虽然也许可以完成，但更重要的是会影响团队风气，最总加快团队的分崩离析。

##遇到一件非常重要且紧急的任务，你是如何处理的？最后的结果如何？
充分沟通，遇到紧急任务，我们容易忘记思考只想着立马执行，结果手忙脚乱，甚至未能按期完成。进一步搜集信息从而评估任务的真实紧急度和按时完成的概率，能帮助我们做出更好的应对策略，逐渐培养自己处乱不惊的品质。充分沟通是搜集信息的高效方式，在接到紧急任务后先做沟通，比如去了解这个任务的源头是谁？为什么这么着急？如果未按时完成会有什么后果？任务的具体的要求等。
分布来做，试着把这个任务拆解成若干小任务，按照优先级逐步推进，把先完成的部分交付出去，让相关方不必长时间干等，也许是个不错的解决方案。
给个排期，任务不一定是要你马上就完成，但是他们需要一个计划，这个计划只要在他们接受范围内即可。

Whenever I hold the steering wheel, I feel extremely careful, which makes me understand the responsibility.More, I can help my parents drive when they are tired. This small matter makes me feel very happy, because it means that I can also contribute to my family.
##9.What the ideal boss look like you want work with?
